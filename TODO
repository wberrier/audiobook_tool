- normalize audio?
- document typical use cases
   1. Combining a whole bunch of mp3 (or any format that ffmpeg supports) to a single
      .m4b file in one swoop.
   2. Doing each step manually so you can adjust the chapter list. (Note, you can also
      do use case #1, and then extract chapter list, modify it, and then set it again)
   3. Ripping an audiobook from cds only differs in that you create the input files
      (wav files) first, and then continue with the other use cases
- Add a verbose option, (ie: the user probably doesn't want to see the ffmpeg
  input output)

- implement "gen_chapter_list_from_cddbid".
  it would fetch track info from the cddb and spit out the chapters

- be able to submit tracks from chapter list to cddb?

- interactive detection of chapters via silence detection (ie: 3 seconds)
 (I guess mp3cut does something similar?)
